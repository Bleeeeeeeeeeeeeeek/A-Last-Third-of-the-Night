# thirdofthenight
Calculate the last third of the night based on time for Maghrib and Fajr.


Open source

# Usage

Very simple. Get the Maghrib and Fajr times for your location (make sure they are correct)! Once you've selected the times, click on 'Calculate'.

# Development

I will only be updating this with features that are requested and are beneficial. I will try to fix bugs that users report to me.
